## Introduction

- The Weibo User Depression Detection Dataset **(WU3D)** contains normal user samples and depressed user samples collected by a crawler using the crawling API provided by the Weibo official. 
- The dataset is stored by JSON files, with `depressed.json` for the depressed users and `normal.json` for the normal users. It can be download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nzURaI60wF2s4P9-G2JDowirrx0VBelE/view?usp=sharing) or [Baidu Netdisk (百度云盘，提取码yar1)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/10xItuplkTNMmJdOEGBiXPw).

| Dataset    | Category  |  User  |  Tweet   | Picture |
| ---------- | --------- | :----: | :------: | :-----: |
| Candidates | Depressed | 125479 | 5478806  | 2354701 |

## Explanations and Issues

- In order to protect the privacy of depressed users, we have deleted the user IDs in WU3D.
- Instead, **we have uploaded the crawler script** and the script for data preprocessing. Researchers can further collect user samples based on our scripts. All the scripts and the deployment document `README.md` are placed in the folder `WU3D_crawler_preprocessing`.
- If  `encoding='utf-8'` doesn't work, try: `encoding='utf-8-sig'` when using `Python` to load the JSON file.

- Other issues will be updated soon...
